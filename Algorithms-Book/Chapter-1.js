/*Stan learned something today: that directly decrementing an arrayâ€™s .length immediately shortens it
by that amount. Given array arr and number X, remove all except the last X elements, and return arr
(changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it. */
